                    <p>
                        Unity Square is a community organizing and social concerns initiative of Catholic Charities, Diocese of Metuchen that works to empower community members and catalyze change in the poorest residential neighborhood of New Brunswick, NJ. In so doing, Unity Square addresses a diverse set of issues, including economic development, employment, civic participation, crime and safety, immigrants’ rights, and tenants’ rights.

                        Unity Square’s efforts focus on a target neighborhood of about 6,000 low-income residents.  Most neighborhood families are working poor, and have young children. Most of the adults are Spanish-speaking immigrants from the Mexican state of Oaxaca.

                <h3><a href="http://www.holyfamilyforall.org/">Holy Family Parish</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Holy Family Parish shares in the vision that Pope Francis has set forth for the entire Catholic Church—to be a welcoming home for all, a community in humble service to one another and to those around us. We are, as Francis himself puts it, a church that is poor and for the poor.

                    As a parish formed from three distinct communities spread across varied urban neighborhoods of New Brunswick, New Jersey, Holy Family represents a community "reconciled in diversity," which celebrates our unity as a followers of one Lord, Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
                    
                    We open our doors to all, no matter what language they speak, where they are from, or what their background may be. As our city continues to grow and change, so too will our parish, as we welcome new parishioners, embrace different cultural traditions, and forge a new path together as a community of faith. We are, and will be, Holy Family for all.

            <p>
                The New Brunswick Saturday Scholars Academy provides an opportunity for 11th-grade students from the New Brunswick high schools to enhance their understanding of mathematical and scientific concepts and applications, and to improve their writing and reading comprehension skills. The program is designed to strengthen problem-solving skills, abstract reasoning, critical thinking, and written/oral expression.

                Coupled with SAT preparation and other academic components, the New Brunswick scholars are also introduced to experimental science in both laboratory and classroom settings. In addition, the Academy hosts guest speakers every week from different professional tracks, particularly those from the science or health-allied professions. The speakers are able to provide the students with realistic perspectives about the time, effort, and energy that are invested into a potential career choice. Lastly, the primary goal and hope of the Academy is to develop competitive students for college admission and scholarships.
